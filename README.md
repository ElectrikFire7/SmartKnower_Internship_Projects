Projects completed as a part of my online internship and training with SmartKnower



## Minor Project: Gender prediction based on voice input
* Initialised prediction models for Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forrest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, SVM classifier using SciKit Learn library.
* Trained and tested above mentioned models for the given Data
* Concluded Random Forrest Classifier is most accurate using confusion Matrix



## Major Project: Different types of Models to predict if a person earns more than 50,000
* Decided which columns to be dropped based on the correlation factor for training and testing.
* Produced the above-mentioned models and compared them using Confusion Matrix.
